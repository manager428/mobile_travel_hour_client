# travel_hour

Travel Hour is a complete travel guide app which is completely developed on Googleâ€™s Flutter.
It has also a admin panel which is also developed on Flutter Web. It works on both android & iOS.
We have used Firestore Database as backend and Provider for state management and applied lots of animations to make this user friendly. 
We have used Google maps and Its APIs to get nearby data like hotels and restaurants and show routes between the source and destination.
